# Intro

The purpose of these changes is to make this activity a bit more reliable and to make it clear that "secret" means secret.

## Any secret check

- If the check is secret...
  - ...you can't use Hero Points after the roll, because you don't know the result.
    - but you can use it before the roll to give yourself an advantage.
  - ...and you roll it as public, I can ask you to roll again in secret (depends on severity of the check).
    - This is more of a way to stop any attempts at soft cheating

## Recall Knowledge specifics

- RAW ruling is [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Actions.aspx?ID=2367).
- Basic flow should follow the description in the link.
- Below are differences and clarifications.

### Repeated attempts

- You can try to Recall more information after the first attempt
  - Unless you failed critically.
  - Additional attempts will be with higher DC
    - Unless you have new information. Example of this would be a monster using an ability for the first time. Recalling on this specific ability would use the base DC.

### Feats and abilities

For builds heavily relying on Recall Knowledge, there might be exceptions/changes to previously described rules.

#### Example: Mastermind Rogue Racket

- You can choose to do Recall Knowledge to purely serve as a way to make an enemy Off-guard. In that case, you can use the base DC even on repeated attempts.

#### Example: Investigator Known Weakness Class Feat

- You can choose to use you free Recall Knowledge only for the bonus to attack rolls, thus using the base DC.
