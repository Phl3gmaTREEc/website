# Intro

- I've been GMing Pathfinder 2e games for couple years at this point and I've collected some ideas on how to do some things a bit defferently (compared to "rules as written").
  - Some changes might be about balance, some about ease of use, some for fun


## Commonly used optional rules

- [Free Archetype](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=2751) is ON, unless specified in game description.
  - Even though it gives the players a bit more power and can make the balancing more difficult, I still like it.
- [Gradual Ability Boost](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1300) is also my favorite. Just makes the jump more ... gradual.
  - The only limitation is that you can't get your modifiers to +5 before level 10

## House Rules

In this section we have some changes to rules/systems in game.

### Recall Knowledge and hidden checks

- List is [here]({{< ref "./recall-knowlegde.md" >}}).
- It's nothing complicated, just minor adjustments.

## Changes to Spells

- Some things need change and the list of changes for spells in my games is below.
- *Note:* This is section is WIP.

#### Stifling Stillness

- [Full text](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=1322) of the spell.
- Creatures will become Fatigued only after (Crit)Failing the basic save.
- They way I read it "as written" would suggest Fatigued just applying even on best results.
  - That seems a bit too much. There might be more changes.
