# Intro

- This is a with basic information. Down bellow you can find links to specific game systems and other topics.

## Before the game

- Are you looking to join anything more than a one-shot? I'll schedule a short interview with you over Discord voice chat.
  - Please make sure to use the microphone you plan to use in actual game session - mic check is on part of the chat.
  - Introductions are next. After introducing myself, I'll probably ask about your experience with the system and VTT platform. Anything else you are willing to share is a bonus.
  - Q&A 
  - Should take 10-20 minutes.
- Session 0 is gonna be next.
  - Nothing unusual there.
  - Player introductions.
  - Safety tools - more info soon

## How do I run my games then?

- these points are true, unless stated otherwise in a more specific page.

### Fan of player characters

- No matter the system I'm always fan of the PCs and I'm not playing against players - it's collaborative storytelling, not some king of Player versus GM.

### I'm all ears

- Players are encouraged to talk to me about any issue they might be having
  - Would you like to change something in the game?
  - Other player(s) are making the game less enjoyable?
  - Do you have suggestion to improve something?
  - Questions about anything?
  - Need help?

- **... Let's talk.** I'll do my best to handle anything you bring to my attention.
