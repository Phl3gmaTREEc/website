# Intro

- In this post, I would like to describe how I run my games and what you can expect from me, should you be interested in joining one of my games 
- This document will be updated, when something new happens in my game and should be cover here

# How I run my games?

- This can obviously depend on specific game system, but generally speaking I try to be laid back about most things

## Rules?

- I'm not some hardcore follower of every rule in every system under any condition
  - Rule of cool can be applied in some cases
- On the other hand rules are there for a reason, so don't expect me to hand wave everything

### Example would be nice

- In my Pathfinder 2e game I do not follow "Recall knowledge" rules to a letter
  - Rules as written seem a bit to much punishing
  - I'm not gonna feed you false information, that could actually harm you

## Kicking player out is a possibility as last resolve

- So far, I've been lucky enough to not have an asshole player in my game, but should it happen, I'll kick their ass, even if it's a payed game
  - Player can be kicked on the spot, if their behaviour is really bad. With minor incident we can talk about it and see, if we can make it work
  - A short interview before accepting a player and Session 0 should hopefully reduce the chance of that happening
- Player can be also asked to leave, if they simply do not fit rest of the group
  - This is never gonna happen on the spot
  - Some discussion will take place, with the hope of making sure everybody is happy

# Talk to me

- Players are encouraged to talk to me about any issue they might be having
  - Would you like to change something in the game?
  - Other player(s) are making the game less enjoyable?
  - Do you have suggestion to improve something?
  - **... Let's talk.** I'll do me best to handle anything you bring to my attention
